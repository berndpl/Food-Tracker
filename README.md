Guilt free dietary tracking

A light weight approach on tracking your consumption of unhealthy food. Become aware of how much you consume without being judged. Adding tracked food types isn’t connected t a diet or advice. It’s about awareness, first. Helping you reflect and draw your own conclusions.

## Quick and imperfect
It takes 2 seconds to track an item using the today widget. Simple tap one of 3 presets that matches your intake most closely (beverage, sweets, meal). You can edit entries later, but you don’t have to.
